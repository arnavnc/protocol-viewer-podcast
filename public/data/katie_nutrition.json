Beans, lentils, and soy-based foods supply plant protein and iron, supporting healthy hemoglobin and energy levels, while also helping to lower LDL cholesterol and Apo B. Fatty fish like mackerel and sardines are rich in omega-3s, which can improve LDL particle size and reduce inflammation. Nuts, seeds, and olive oil offer healthy fats and antioxidants that support hormone balance and cardiovascular health. Colorful fruits and vegetables like cranberries, apples, broccoli, and cabbage provide fiber and phytonutrients that help regulate cholesterol, support immune defenses, and maintain gut and urinary tract health. Together, these foods create a foundation for balanced hormones, improved blood markers, and sustained energy.",
