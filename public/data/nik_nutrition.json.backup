Regular intake of soy and legume-based foods will also complement your good sleep patterns, helping your body reset hormone pathways overnight.",
      "scientific_rationale": "Soy foods like tempeh, tofu, and edamame are rich in phytoestrogens (isoflavones), which can bind to estrogen receptors and help reduce the effects of excess estradiol by modulating receptor activity. Legumes such as black beans and lentils provide soluble fiber that promotes the excretion of estrogen through the digestive tract, lowering circulating levels. These foods work together to support healthy hormone metabolism, which is particularly important for men with elevated estradiol, as it may help reduce risks related to metabolic and reproductive health. Regular inclusion of these foods can also positively influence cholesterol and inflammation, supporting overall preventive health.",

      "personalized_note": "With your average resting heart rate of 58 bpm and a consistent exercise schedule, your cardiovascular foundation is strong. To further protect against heart risk, prioritizing cholesterol particle remodeling foods will add resilience. Since you're already supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids, focusing on whole food sources like fatty fish, nuts, and oats will reinforce those benefits.",
      "scientific_rationale": "These foods support healthier cholesterol profiles by increasing LDL particle size and raising large HDL particles, both of which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk. Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce triglycerides and promote larger, less harmful LDL particles. Nuts (walnuts, almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts) and extra virgin olive oil are rich in unsaturated fats and plant sterols, which help shift cholesterol toward protective forms and improve HDL function. Whole grains like oats and barley contain beta-glucan, a soluble fiber that binds cholesterol in the gut and encourages favorable lipid remodeling. Legumes and vegetables add fiber and antioxidants, supporting overall lipid metabolism and vascular health.",

Red and processed meats contain compounds that elevate creatinine and may worsen cardiovascular risk by increasing LDL and altering HDL profiles. Frequent consumption of these foods is linked to chronic kidney disease progression and higher rates of heart disease, while limiting them helps maintain healthy kidney function, improves lipid markers, and reduces inflammation. By avoiding these foods, you support your body's natural filtration systems and lower your risk for chronic conditions.",
