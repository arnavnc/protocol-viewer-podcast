Mechanistically, resistance exercise increases muscle metabolism, elevates free testosterone, and improves lipid profiles, which is especially beneficial for a healthy 33-year-old male aiming for preventive care. Regular strength training at this life stage maximizes metabolic health, supports optimal hormone levels, and reduces long-term disease risk.",
