      "action": "START",
      "scientific_rationale": "Strength training directly improves lipid biomarkers (LDL, total cholesterol, Apo B) by increasing muscle mass and enhancing metabolic health, which helps lower cardiovascular risk. It also supports hormone optimization by promoting healthy testosterone and progesterone levels, and can increase ferritin and MCHC through improved red blood cell production. For women in their 40s, strength training is especially important for maintaining bone density, supporting longevity, and improving sleep and energy, all of which are crucial for preventive health and post-pregnancy recovery.",
