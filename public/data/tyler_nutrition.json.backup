Leafy greens (spinach, kale, broccoli) and legumes (lentils, edamame, soybeans) supply iron, folate, and plant-based protein to support healthy red blood cell production and improve MCH and MCHC. Animal proteins like chicken, lamb, beef steak, and especially chicken liver deliver heme iron, B vitamins, and zinc, which are more efficiently absorbed and help maintain optimal hematocrit and hormone levels. Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines) are rich in omega-3s, which can improve LDL particle size, lower inflammation, and support cardiovascular health. Nuts (almonds, pistachios) and apples add fiber and antioxidants, helping to manage cholesterol and support liver health. Together, these foods work synergistically to optimize blood, hormone, and heart biomarkers.",
